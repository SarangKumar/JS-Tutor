Just like normal Grammar in regular languages we have syntax in JavaScript that needs to be followed so that the instructions run smoothly.
# Variables

These are like containers that store data. Then to access the same you may use the variable.

Js is dynamically typed: no need to predefine the type of data that will be stored in variable.*Opposite is Statically typed. Eg `C`*

#### Syntax

```javascript
let a = 67;
a = 'name' //changing the data type is valid in Js
console.log(a) //function to print the value in console/cmd
```

#### Rules for writing variables

- Letter, digits, _ and $ are allowed
- Variable name should not start with digit
- Variable name should not be a keyword
- Variables are case-sensitive
