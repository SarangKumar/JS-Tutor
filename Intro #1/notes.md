# Intoduction to Programming

Language of Computers. There are instructions that a pc follows to get the desired output.
Computer is a dump machine that has all the logic predefined and on top of that you write you logic.

## What is Ecmascript?

This is the standard on which Js is based. JS follows the standards of ECMA so that the output of all the instructions is same for all the instructions in JS irrespective of the environment.

### Features

- JS and ECMA terms can be used interchangeably (almost everytime)
- JS is very liberal

#### How to execute JS

- Use browers
- Use runtime - `node.js`
- Use third party softwares - `sandbox`, `replit`, `codepen`



> **Note**
>
> You need to download [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to follow along with the sessions

#### Using node.js

After installing node run the following commmand to check if it is installed properly and added to path. Output is supposed to be the version of the node that is installed (*for me it's v16.17.1, but since it changes very rapidly you may expect higher versions in comming future*)

```bash
node -v
```
or
```bash
node --version
```

To run the js script:
-  Make a file with extension as .js for example `filename.js`. 
- Then go to the folder where you have saved the file and write 
```bash
node filename.js
```
